# MiniFace HTTP Server

MiniFace HTTP Server is the minimal replica of facebook with custom socket server implementation, custom framework. It servers html pages using quik templating engine, and data is handled with sqlite.

Note : This project is just to demonstrate minimal http server, and none of the techniques are scaled to their standard and efficient level.

## Running Instructions

**Github Repository - **
	
- *Branch Master* - 
This branch contains code to run server and client on browser.

- *Branch Client* - 
This Branch contains code to run server and `cli` client on terminal.
	
In the root directory of the project
`python server\server.py` will start the server instance.

Client - We have implemented a server to handle HTTP Requests, hence browser can be used as a client or run client.py file by following commands

> Default - run `http://localhost:8080` on browser


**Client Branch - How to run Client-server: **

> Server: `python3 server/server.py`

> Client: `python3 server/client.py client `

> Client-Server: `python3 server/client.py server`


To chat with a friend, first look at what all friends are online first press 4 to check his/her/their IP and then press 2 to go to the chat option. Input the IP of that friend and a chat will start.
