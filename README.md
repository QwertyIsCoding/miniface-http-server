Running Instructions

How to run:

To chat with a friend in the client terminal, first look at what all friends are online first press 4 to check his/her/their IP and then press 2 to go to the chat option. Input the IP of that friend and a chat will start. To exit from the chat enter ‘Quit’. Note, you can only chat if the other party’s client-server is on.

These are all the options we have put in the CLI side of the project.
